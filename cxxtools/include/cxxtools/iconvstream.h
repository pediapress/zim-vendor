  To perform a character set conversion from one characterset to
  another, instantiate a iconvstream with a std::ostream as a sink.
  Write the data to the iconvstream and the converted stream is
  written to the sink.

  example (unix2win-filter):
  \code
    int main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
      cxxtools::iconvstream out(std::cout, "LATIN1", "WINDOWS-1251");
